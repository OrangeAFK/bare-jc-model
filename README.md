# bare-jc-model

The Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model is one of the simplest models in quantum electrodynamics (QED), describing the behavior of a quantum harmonic oscillator interacting with a two-level system.

Examples include an atom interacting with a cavity mode, and, in the case of circuit QED, a superconducting qubit interacting with a microwave resonator.
